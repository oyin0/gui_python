Using the Keele's University Library map includes a list of classmarks for each subject, and shows the location of each classmark. Two csv files has been provided. One contains classmarks and the equivalent subjects and the second contains classmarks and the equivalent locations.
The project is to write codes that prompts the user to select one of three options: whether to enter a subject name or partname (e.g. “English”), a classmark, or a location. Also, prompts (according to the previous response) the user to enter the subject name/part-name, classmark or location (with location options displayed); and finally outputs each matching classmark together with its location and subject name(s).
The two csv files are named 'csv1' and 'csv2'
The csv files were read into python in 'reading_csv' file
The main codes were written in the 'function' file which was imported to be used in the 'textapp' and 'gui' files. The 'textapp' file shows carrying out the project in just a text-based application while 'gui' file shows carrying out the project using a Graphic User Interface.
